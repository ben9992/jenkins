    When specifying a path inside the workspace here, Jenkins applies the artifact pattern only to this directory, and
    artifact paths are relative to this directory. For example, if you want to archive files matching the pattern
    'module/dist/**/*.zip' but don't want the folders 'module/dist' show up as part of the result artifact paths, you
    can specify 'module/dist' here, and instead use the pattern '**/*.zip' above. This way, Jenkins archives paths like
    'foo/bar.zip' rather than 'module/dist/foo/bar.zip'. Only files inside this path (relative to the workspace) can be
    archived. If left empty, Jenkins applies the archive pattern relative to the workspace.
